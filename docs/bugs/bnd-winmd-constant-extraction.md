# bnd-winmd: Cannot extract `static const` variables or complex macro constants

## Summary

bnd-winmd only extracts `#define` macros that expand to simple literal values. It cannot extract:

1. **`static const` variables** — These are not preprocessor macros and require semantic analysis.
2. **Complex macro expressions** — Macros using other macros or functions like `RTE_BIT64(n)` are not evaluated.
3. **Build-config constants** — Values from generated headers like `rte_build_config.h` that depend on the build configuration.

## Examples

### `static const` (not extracted)

```c
// wrapper.h
static const uint64_t RUST_RTE_ETH_RSS_IPV4 = RTE_ETH_RSS_IPV4;
```

These are used as a workaround to expose `RTE_BIT64(n)` macro values, but bnd-winmd ignores them since they aren't `#define` macros.

### Complex macros (not extracted)

```c
// rte_ethdev.h
#define RTE_ETH_RSS_IPV4 RTE_BIT64(2)
```

`RTE_BIT64` is itself a macro (`(1ULL << (n))`), so the expression is not a simple literal.

### Build-config constants (not extracted)

```c
// rte_build_config.h (generated by meson)
#define RTE_MAX_LCORE 128
#define RTE_MAX_NUMA_NODES 32
```

These are simple `#define` macros but live in a generated header that may not be in the traverse list.

## Workaround

Define the constants manually in a Rust compatibility module (`ffi.rs`):

```rust
pub const RTE_MAX_LCORE: u32 = 128;
pub const RUST_RTE_ETH_RSS_IPV4: u64 = 1 << 2;
```

## Impact

Any constant that isn't a simple `#define NAME literal` requires manual Rust definitions, which is error-prone and must be kept in sync with the C headers.

## Component

bnd-winmd (C-to-winmd stage) — would benefit from:
- Evaluating constant expressions in `#define` macros (at least for common patterns like bit shifts)
- Optionally extracting `static const` variable values
- Supporting `#include` of build-config headers in the traverse list
