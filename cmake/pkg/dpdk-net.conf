# ldconfig priority for dpdk-net's DPDK libraries.
#
# SPDK installs a stripped-down DPDK (same soname, e.g. librte_eal.so.26)
# under /opt/spdk/lib/ via spdk.conf. That build excludes net PMD drivers
# (net_null, net_ring, net_tap, etc.), so if the dynamic linker resolves
# SPDK's libs first, EAL fails with "failed to parse device net_null0".
#
# This file sorts before spdk.conf alphabetically (dpdk-net < spdk),
# ensuring our full DPDK install at /usr/local takes priority.
